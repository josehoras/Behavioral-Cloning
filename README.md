# Behavioral Cloning Project

[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---

In this project I develop a convolutional neural network in **Keras** to achieve autonomous driving of a car within a simulator provided in the Udacity environment.

 A simulation shows the car completing a lap on the track succesfully.

The deliverables for the project are:

* [model.py](model.py) containing the script to create and train the model
* [drive.py](drive.py) for driving the car in autonomous mode
* [model.h5](model.h5) containing a trained convolution neural network 
* [run1.mp4](run1.mp4) containing a video demontration of my simulation
* [A writeup](writeup.md) summarizing the results

Check out the [writeup](writeup.md) for a detailed discussion on steps, challenges and results encountered in this project.

The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior 
* Design, train and validate a model that predicts a steering angle from image data
* Use the model to drive the vehicle autonomously around the first track in the simulator. The vehicle should remain on the road for an entire loop around the track.
* Summarize the results with a written report

### Dependencies
This lab requires:

* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

The lab enviroment can be created with CarND Term1 Starter Kit. Click [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) for the details.

The following resources can be found in this github repository:
* drive.py
* video.py
* writeup_template.md

The simulator can be downloaded from the classroom. In the classroom, we have also provided sample data that you can optionally use to help train your model.
